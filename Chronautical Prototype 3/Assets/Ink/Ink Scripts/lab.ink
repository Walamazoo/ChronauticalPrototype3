        - 9:    A layer of dust covers everything in the lab, but there was hardly anything for it to cover besides the floor and walls. I feel a quiet and deep rumbling far below me.
        - 10:   What was once a lab has now been completely swallowed up by a monsterous hole. Fire has consumed most of the other sections of the building, but the hole seems to shoot straight down to the center of the planet.

"That's preposterous."
"You are no longer employed here and you should know that civilians are strictly prohibited access to any of the vaultâ€™s highly classified materials."

        "It's imperative that I get them."

        #sprite:Alistair_Sad
        "Sir, please."
        "I know that this is a breach of protocol, but perhaps you could make an exception for an ex-intern?"

        #speaker:Director
        "Hmph."
        "What even is it that you want from the vault?"
    + [Notes]
        #speaker:Alistair
        #sprite:Alistair_Neutral
        "My research notes. They're still inside the vault."
        
        #speaker:Director
        "Those notes belong to the lab now."
        "When you left your position, those materials became part of the collective research of the lab."
        
    + [Something?]
        #speaker:Alistair
        #sprite:Alistair_Nervous
        "Uh well..."
        (Think! What should I say?)
        "It's... something?"
        "I just, I really need it."
    - 
        #speaker:Director
        "Absolutely not."
        "No, access to the vault is prohibited."
        "It matters not what it is you want from it."
    + [I must]
        #speaker:Alistair
        #sprite:Alistair_Confident
            "I must get into the vault, sir!"

            "Please, sir, I need to get into the vault..."

        #speaker:Director
        "Silence, I have already made my decision."
        "Begone now, I am incredibly occupied at the moment."

(How infuriating!)
(Speaking to Bennet is like talking to a wall...)

#speaker:D4RL1N6
#NPC:Darling_Annoyed
"That was fruitless."

#speaker:Alistair
#sprite:Alistair_Neutral
"Indeed."
"What do we do now?"

#speaker:D4RL1N6
#NPC:Darling_Neutral
"It is improbable that Mr. Bennet Crabb is the only one who can get into the vault."
"Perhaps we can seek out another employee."
#NPC:Darling_Happy
"They may be able to help us or shed light on new information. "

#speaker:Alistair
"Jules still works for the lab. We interned together."
"I left, but he stayed and got a full time job."
"He did always like the library in this place..."
"Perhaps he can help since we can't get through to Bennet."

I move closer to the crowd to listen in.
A small projected version of the lab's Director, Bennet Crabb, stands on a pedastal in the center of the crowd.

"In further announcements..."
"As some of you may have already heard..."
"Rumors have been circulating that the planet NAME has been destroyed under mysterious circumstances."
"However, it is best not to feed into gossip till we can determine what it was that caused this disaster."
"It is more than likely that the planet's core malfunctioned which is a very rare occurance."
"There is no need to worry."
"Indeed. Next month, the lab will host a festival..."

Booth upon booth line the lab's walls. 
Young and old scientists stand in front of their experiments to demonstrate their discoveries and to discuss with judges their findings.
I remember doing the same when I was a fresh intern.

The Director's projected form stands tall over the group of people around him.
Everyone is silent, just looking up.

"Ahem..."
"..."
"I am speaking to you all, the entire planet of Elore-Nabyke, to make an announcement."
"An announcement of a recent discovery."
"..."
"It is no secret that our planet's core is a mechanical thing prone to wear and tear. 
"We at the lab take great care in maintaining the core to extend the life of our planet by some 50 to 100 years."
"But."
"It was discovered this morning that the core has taken on more damages than we had anticipated."
"The damage to the core is... mysterious in nature."
"We do not know where it originated though we are investigating."
"It is with my..."
"Deepest regret that I must announce that the planet will be inhabitable in 5 years time and subsequently destroyed."

The lab employees are silent but a few dip their heads.
